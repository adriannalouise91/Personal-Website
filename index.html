                        <p>Welcome to my digital battlefield, where I bravely share my experiences, insights, and tips
                            to
                            instill
                            courage in those who feel lost in a vast and ever-changing industry. Within these virtual
                            pages,
                            you
                            will read about my own trials and tribulations, as well as effective strategies for breaking
                            through
                            limiting beliefs, one line of code at a time.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As I began my transition into tech, I was fully aware that I was entering a world driven by
                            innovation,
                            empowerment, and endless learning. For me, coding is not only a form of creative expression
                            but
                            also
                            a
                            powerful tool that allows me to question existing norms and continuously break down barriers
                            I
                            never
                            thought possible for myself.
                            <br><br>
                            I invite you to join me on this journey, as I hope to inspire those who are afraid to take
                            those
                            initial
                            steps or are lost in the process. Together, we will explore the ever-evolving world of
                            development,
                            where each line of code we write serves as a bold statement of our unwavering ambition and
                            determination.
                            <br><br>
                            So, who am I? My name is Adrianna, and I am a self-taught web developer from Montana. I made
                            the
                            transition into the tech industry from Real Estate in 2021. While I will always have a
                            fondness
                            for
                            the
                            scrappy world of Real Estate, I felt unfulfilled. Computers have always been a natural
                            interest
                            for
                            me
                            since a young age. However, I used to believe that Software Engineering was a field reserved
                            only
                            for
                            the most intelligent minds. Nevertheless, I took the leap anyway.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Throughout these last two
                            years,
                            I've
                            encountered setbacks, questioned my chosen path, and grappled with self-doubt. But rest
                            assured,
                            I'm
                            here to show you that if I can navigate this path, so can you. Join me as I fearlessly
                            pursue my
                            goals
                            and document them each step of the way.
